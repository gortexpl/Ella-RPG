# Ella-RPG


A 3d platformer german expressionism painting like game where you play a character named Ell who lost her partner/boyfriend to a car accident and is in a depression like lucid nightmarish dream who is fighting to escape or succumb to it in which it would result in her death, along the way she has to look for clues (things that remind her of him) left by her boyfriend to show her how to be empowered and to overcome the bout of depression to escape the dream. Similar to Murasaki Baby and Edward Gorey.
